            This is a picture from the <strong>Park City, Utah</strong> area. 
            Utah is one of my favorite places because the scenery is goregous
            no matter the season and there is so much fun stuff to do!

        My favorite restaurant is 
        <a href="https://committeeboston.com/" target="_blank">Committee</a>
        , a Greek small plate restaurant in Boston <br />
        <br>
        Something no one would expect about me is that I know how to knit! <br />
